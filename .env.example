# Browser and Session Management
# These settings control browser behavior and session handling

# Controls how often browser parameters are randomized
# Values: strict (every request), medium (every 5 requests), relaxed (only between parent jobs)
SESSION_STABILITY=medium

# Session Management Settings
# These settings control how the scraper manages its sessions and error handling

# Maximum number of jobs to process in a single session before rotating
# Lower values provide better protection but slower operation
MAX_JOBS_PER_SESSION=10

# Cooldown time between sessions in seconds
# Helps avoid detection by adding natural pauses
SESSION_COOLDOWN=300

# Maximum number of consecutive errors before stopping
# Helps prevent wasteful operations when something goes wrong
MAX_CONSECUTIVE_ERRORS=3

# Backup Proxy Configuration
# You can configure multiple backup proxies that will be rotated automatically
# Use comma-separated lists for multiple proxies
# Example: host1.proxy.com,host2.proxy.com,host3.proxy.com

# List of backup proxy hostnames
BACKUP_PROXY_HOSTS=

# List of backup proxy ports
BACKUP_PROXY_PORTS=

# List of backup proxy usernames

# Important Notes:
# 1. Never commit this file with real credentials
# 2. Update cookies regularly as they expire
# 3. Use residential proxies for better success rate
# 4. Keep proxy sessions short to avoid detection
# 5. Rotate between multiple sets of cookies if possible
# 6. Configure multiple backup proxies for better reliability
# 7. Adjust session settings based on your needs:
#    - Lower MAX_JOBS_PER_SESSION for better protection
#    - Higher SESSION_COOLDOWN for more natural behavior
#    - Adjust MAX_CONSECUTIVE_ERRORS based on stability
